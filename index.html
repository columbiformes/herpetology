                <p>The Bay Area has a unique climate that makes up one of the most biodiverse hotspots in the world. From coastal marshes to drought-tolerant hills, the local wildlife has adapted to specific niches - and these creatures are everywhere, if you know how to look. The mild Mediterranean climate is especially kind to cold-blooded animals, which rely on external conditions to maintain body temperature. These animals are often feared and reviled by the general public, but they are also incredibly adapted to their surroundings and full of character.</p>

                <h2>What is Herping?</h2>
                <p>Herpetology comes from the Greek word <i>herpein</i>, meaning “to creep”. Herpetology, therefore, is the study of reptiles and amphibians, which are collectively (and lovingly) referred to as “herps”. To go “herping” is to go searching for these animals in their natural habitat. Despite the funny name, herping is a fantastic way to find animals around you.
                </p>

                <p>Ben Pridonoff, a wildlife biologist, recommends herping for beginners and experts alike. You don’t need a lot of knowledge to start, only a healthy dose of curiosity and a willingness to get your hands dirty. 
                </p>
                
                <q>You don’t really realize how many animals are out there in these little cracks and crevices, hiding away in the environment, until you start herping. So just be ready to see the whole world of nature open up in front of you.</q>

                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p>Each species has its preferred habitat, but a good general rule is to search near water. Streams and ponds are great places to begin. They’re also commonly found in microhabitats, particularly underneath rocks and logs, or in small shaded areas where they can cool off from the sun. Over time, you will begin developing a sense of where to look.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>These are two examples of prime herping habitat. The log on the left is somewhat embedded into the leaf litter, creating space underneath for animals to live. The shaded area under the rock is a perfect refuge from the hot midday sun - and in fact, we found a rattlesnake in there!</p>
            
            <p>Don’t be afraid to go off the trail, but make sure you watch where you’re going - rattlesnakes sometimes hide in tall grass. Look for fallen logs or other decomposing vegetation, which attracts the insects that herps like to eat. </p>

                <h2>Techniques</h2>
                <p>In order to be a successful herper, you can’t be afraid to get your hands dirty! Herping involves flipping rocks, logs, wooden boards, and venturing off the path into dusty places. You may leave the marked trail and head to muddier, less frequented areas - after all, animals tend to stay away from places with high foot traffic.</p>
                    
                <p>However, the first priority should always be safety - both yours, and the safety of the animals you’re searching for.</p>

            <br/>
                <ul>To stay safe, Ben recommends:
                    <li>go with a friend, especially on your first few trips</li>
                    <li>know the species you’re dealing with, especially the venomous species in the area</li>
                    <li>know your environment</li>
                    <li>be aware of your worst-case scenarios and what the procedure is</li>
                </ul>
               
                <p>In California, the only venomous snake is the rattlesnake. Knowing this information allows you to prepare a plan in case you get bitten, and it also informs you that the other species aren’t life-threatening</p>

                <h2>Common Species</h2>
                <p>There are over 50 species of reptiles and amphibians in the Bay Area. Some, like the Western fence lizard, are extremely common, while others are more reclusive in nature. While it's hard to predict what you'll find on any given hike, here's a small sampling of some species you could encounter.</p>

            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>For those wishing to learn more, Ben recommends Seek by iNaturalist. He describes Seek as “the best, most accessible way to learn what species are around you without having a lot of knowledge.” </p>
            <p>Abhas Misraraj, who was on the team that developed Seek, designed the app to make nature more accessible to everyone, even those who are brand new to the subject. You can take a photo of any living creature, plant or animal, and the app will attempt to identify it for you. By adding challenges and badges for collecting a certain number of species, Seek essentially turns animal and plant identifying into a game. This design was intentional - Abhas says that he created his own dream app.</p>
            <q>I essentially designed Seek for my own five year old self. I designed it because, if I was 5 years old and I had something like Seek, I would read every species page for every species near me.</q>
            <br/>
            <div style="display: flex">
            <img class="image" style="margin-right: 10px;" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15970426265ca7e2b.jpg">
            <img class="image" style="margin-right: 10px;" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15970435744de7026.jpg">
            
        </div>
            
            <br/>
            <p>Abhas is also passionate about lowering the barrier to entry and acknowledges that it can be overwhelming to learn about nature when there are so many species out there. He calls this a form of “nature-blindness”, where people walk by plants and animals every day and ignore it because it all looks the same. However, he believes in the power of naming things because it allows people to start paying attention, and knowing names is the first step to learning more about different species.</p>
            
            <q>When you go out into nature and you’re curious what a species is, or what it’s behavior is, all those answers are out there. The only thing you have to do is be able to identify what it is to find those. Seek is really great for lowering the barrier for that.</q>
